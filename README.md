# musApart_pi
I want to create a project, which can deal with the music. 
Now I want to divide any song into several parts. like drums, bass, human voice, piano and etc..
Then I will use sonic-pi to make my own music.
for sonic-pi: see http://www.sonic-pi.net/
Input: .mp3 or .wav music
Output: different part of the music

------------
PS: It's the first time that I use the opensource concept to develop. I will edit this many times.
Hope people who are interested in music and the project can give me advice or help me.
